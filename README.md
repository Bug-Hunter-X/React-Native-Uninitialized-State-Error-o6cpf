# React Native Uninitialized State Bug

This repository demonstrates a common error in React Native: accessing state variables before they've been initialized.  The bug and its solution are provided in separate JavaScript files.

## Bug
The `UninitializedStateBug.js` file shows how accessing state before it's fully initialized results in an error.

## Solution
The `UninitializedStateSolution.js` file presents a corrected version that avoids the error by properly handling the initialization and potential undefined values.
